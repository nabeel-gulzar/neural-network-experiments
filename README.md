# neural-network-experiments

In this project we implement Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) from scratch and aplly different experiment on it. Initializing weights with different distributions, applying regularization, using different loss functions, and different optimizers. It is self explainatory notebook and all the details are provided in it.
